# Analyze This

## Questions

1a. TODO
Yes

1b. TODO
O(2n) (which simplifies to O(n)). Stelios has to sort through the big pile (all the elements) twice, thus the run time is 2n.

2a. TODO
Yes

2b. TODO
The same as regular bubble sort, O(n^2). Regardless of if she is bubbling left to right or right to left,
the process is esentially the same. The same number of sorts are occurring, and the same number of passes
through the whole set is occurring.

3a. TODO
Yes

3b. TODO
O(n). Ultimately, cards are being discarded one by one until the desired card is found.
This is esentially linear search, except for the fact that the deck is shuffled each time.
Shuffling the deck needlessly adds another step to the algorithm, but shouldn't affect the runtime.
